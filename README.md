Requirements
------------

1. Kafka 0.8.1.1 or 0.8.2-beta
2. sbt 0.13.x
3. Java 7+

Configuration
-------------

The minimum configuration is the zookeeper hosts which are to be used for kafka manager state.
This can be found in the application.conf file in conf directory.  The same file will be packaged
in the distribution zip file; you may modify settings after unzipping the file on the desired server.

    kafka-manager.zkhosts="my.zookeeper.host.com:2181"


Deployment
----------

The command below will create a zip file which can be used to deploy the application.

    sbt clean dist
    mv ./target/universal/kafka-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip /opt
    cd /opt && unzip kafka-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
    /opt/kafka-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/kafka-manager

Open localhost:9000

Optionally, you can run on a different port

    /opt/kafka-manager-1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/kafka-manager -Dhttp.port=9002

Please refer to play framework documentation on production deployment.
